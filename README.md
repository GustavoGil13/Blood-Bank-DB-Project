# Blood-Bank-DB-Project

This was a small project from a course named Data Bases that i had in University.
The folder named SQL has the scripts that are needed to recreate the same DB that was used in this project. To interact with the DB there is a UI writen in Visual Basic in the folder Blood-Bank-DB-UI. There is also a video that shows how the UI works.

## How to use
1. You need to install something like SQL Microsoft Server and Server Express in order to run the scripts in the folder named SQL. The first script needs to be the one named tables and the last the tuples one.
2. After that install Visual Studio so you can edit and run the UI files. In the first form of the VB files change the name of the DB to the name that you gave it. (Currently: BS_Management)
